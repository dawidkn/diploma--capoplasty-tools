# ðŸ“Œ Femoral Head Axis Approximation Macro

**Author:** Dawid K.  
**Repository:** [diploma--capoplasty-tools](https://github.com/dawidkn/diploma--capoplasty-tools)  
**Code location:** `axis_aproximation-program/`  
**Software:** Siemens NX 12 (Macro)  
**Language:** Python (likely using NX Open API)

## ðŸ“– Program Description  

This macro automates the **approximation of the femoral head axis** using a section-based method in **Siemens NX 12**. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the direction of the axis by analyzing cross-sections and optimizing for minimal cross-sectional area.  

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works  

1. **Load the 3D model** â€“ The macro reads the femoral head geometry.  
2. **Calculate the center of mass** â€“ The object's center of gravity is determined, and the model is translated to `(0,0,0)`.  
3. **Initial cross-sections** â€“ The script generates slices in the following planes:  
   - XY  
   - YZ  
   - ZX  
4. **Surface area measurement** â€“ Each sectionâ€™s surface area is calculated.  
5. **Optimal orientation search** â€“ The slicing plane rotates iteratively around **X, Y, and Z axes** to find the smallest cross-section.  
6. **Axis correction iteration** â€“ After determining the minimum cross-section, the macro moves along the perpendicular direction to refine the axis.  
7. **Re-optimization** â€“ The correction step repeats, with further rotations and adjustments to the optimal plane direction.  
8. **Final output** â€“ The femoral head axis is determined and can be used for further analysis.
